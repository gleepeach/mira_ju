                <h2>Mira Ju</h2>
                <p>Hey all. The name given by my parents is Nur Amira Binti Tajudin. 
                    I was born in Perak traditionally using the services of a midwife. 
                    My age is still 20 if followed by month and will increase to 21 years on July 2, 2022 which is this year.
                    There is not much I can share with you all. 
                    This is all I got and it is still fresh in my memory.</strong></p></p>

                <p style="text-align:center;background-color:hsla(9, 100%, 64%, 0.5);">In the past, when I was a child, my grandmother always took me on an old bicycle around the village. 
                    I managed to get into kindergarten when I was 6 years old.
                    For me, it was an unforgettable experience. 
                    This is because, it is my first experience in knowing the meaning of friendship, the meaning of hardship, family values, patience, courage to be independent.
                    I am a shy person and arguably overly shy. 
                    Every time guests came to my house, I would hide and lock the door until their voices were no longer heard in my room. 
                    However, everything has changed since I set foot in kindergarten. 
                    I learned to improve my communication skills with my peers during my first day in kindergarten. 
                    At first, it was very scary for me. This is so, after returning from kindergarten, I will help my grandmother find extra money to continue our life in the village. 
                    My grandmother was a very hardworking, kind-hearted person, too friendly to greet anyone close to her. Sometimes I get confused by such things. 
                    Sometimes I become extravagant because I think with the money I managed to earn as a result of the trade, I will be able to buy all the necessities and wants. 
                    From my grandmother, I was able to cultivate a thrifty nature and be wise in managing expenses. 
                    When I was in grade 1 to grade 6, I managed to collect duit Raya for each year of RM 2000 each year. 
                    I managed to buy a laptop, cover the expenses of books throughout the school session and was able to buy a pink bicycle that has now been sold by my uncle in the village.</p>
            </pre>
            <br>
            <pre>
                <p style="text-align:center;background-color:hsla(9, 100%, 64%, 0.5);">During my time in high school, I only changed schools by 2.
                    As a result of those two school exchanges, I got to know many friends. 
                    During form 2, I moved to a day boarding school. The school is SMK Bandar Baru Salak Tinggi. 
                    Lots of memories there when I was in the hostel. So much so that it is still raging in the mind and thoughts. 
                    The memories I will never forget are when we female students boarded a cook at the warden's house and the male students put on a movie that was so much fun to watch together. 
                    At the end of the year and the end of the SPM examination papers, the hostel had a BBQ that included all Form 5 students at that time. 
                    However, I could not join him because there were family matters that needed to be resolved.</p>
            </pre>
            <br>
            <pre>
                <p style="text-align:center;background-color:hsla(9, 100%, 64%, 0.5);">After finishing school, I started working as a barista in a caf√©. 
                    That was my first time working. 
                    I feel it was a very enjoyable experience. Still, the fun didn't last long. 
                    This is because all the employees there are SPM graduates and all of them including me who have received university calls.</p>
            </pre>

            <pre>
                <p style="text-align:center;background-color:hsla(9, 100%, 64%, 0.5);">On 18/03/2020, all students who were on campus were instructed to return to their respective homes. 
                    At that time, the Coronavirus had begun to spread to Malaysia. I was sad because the experience of living in college that semester was only a month. 
                    Fortunately, UiTM has returned the money that was used to pay the college fees for 6 months. 
                    As long as I was at home, my co-workers and I had to deal with online distance learning to avoid getting the covid19. 
                    However, many things happen as we face online distance learning. 
                    Among them, some had to heat up on the hill to find the internet line to continue learning, 
                    some had families who never understood those who were in class and then told them to do homework while the class was in progress.</p>

            <pre>
                <p style="text-align:center;background-color:hsla(9, 100%, 64%, 0.5);">Day after day, covid no longer haunts Malaysians. Today, many have managed to adapt to the current situation.
                    However, Malaysians have been shocked by natural disasters throughout Malaysia from all states and regions, namely landslides and flash floods. 
                    My home area was among those affected by flash floods and landslides. 
                    At that point, I felt very depressed. 
                    Among the reasons is that at that time I was the only one who was at home because 
                    I wanted to complete all the tasks that had been given and all my family members went on holiday in Johor Bahru and still had not returned at that time. 
                    In that lonely state, I came across a kitten that had just been born at the time. The kitten was in the middle of a rock surrounded by floodwaters. 
                    I felt very sorry and went towards the kitten. 
                    The kitten's mother and siblings have died. Only he is alive. 
                    Once the water in my home area had receded and all the family members had returned home, I felt safe and not lonely. However, all that disappeared in the blink of an eye.
                    The kitten I was caring for, died after reaching the age of a week. My feelings at that time were mixed like that of a mother who had lost her child. 
                    As a result, my family members managed to persuade me by stating that I had tried to take care of him as best I could and it had been noted that his death had arrived. 
                    It's kind of hard for me to accept it.  In a few weeks, I was ready to accept the statement and all the possibilities.</p>

            <pre>
                <p style="text-align:center;background-color:hsla(9, 100%, 64%, 0.5);">Who would have thought that during this pandemic, 
                    I was be able to meet someone very unique and interesting. We spend a lot of time together. 
                    Since the first time I met him on Malaysia's Independence Day, I felt he was quite funny and cute. 
                    Never again have I had an experience with a man like that. His actions, his movements and his mindset are so mysterious and I can't predict. 
                    After our fifth reunion, each of us could not spend time together anymore. 
                    This is because, I am still busy with learning and club activities. 
                    Meanwhile, he is busy working to support his family to continue living. Even though he was still young, I found many challenges he had to face. 
                    Many things in our lives will to some extent make us mature.</p>

    <p style="text-align:center;background-color:hsla(9, 100%, 64%, 0.5);">Here is a quote from the founder of KFC that caught my attention:</p>
    <p style="text-align:center;background-color:hsla(9, 100%, 64%, 0.5);"><blockquote cite="https://global.kfc.com/stories/our-favorite-colonel-sanders-quotes/">
        <p style="text-align:center;background-color:hsla(9, 100%, 64%, 0.5);">‚ÄúI've only had two rules. Do all you can and do it the best you can.‚Äù
			<br></p>
            <p style="text-align:center;background-color:hsla(9, 100%, 64%, 0.5);">The Colonel was undeniably a real-life example of how passion, hard work, and a commitment to quality can lead to success. This is reflected in the house rules that guide us to this day: Be Your Best Self. Make A Difference. Have Fun.
